Music Construction Set Mockingboard interrupt player for Apple II

This is the source code included in the first Music Construction Set version with Mockingboard support. The original version could not be assembled because it was missing some important elements.

A working version was included in the Mockingboard Developer's Toolkit which included some additional corrections but was not available in source form.
